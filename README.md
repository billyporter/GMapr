# GMapr

GMapr is a webapplication built in Angular that is intended to provide a "Snapshot in History". 

Users search for a city to see historical photos and historical information. There are also numerous markers generated on the map surrounding the city that point out specific landmarks and tourist attractions. Users can either click on these markers to view photos, change the filter in the photos section, or click on an empty space in the map to create their own marker.
